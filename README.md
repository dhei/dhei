# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am [@dhei](https://github.com/dhei), an engineer from GitHub who love to build software for developers. I worked for Microsoft [@Azure](https://github.com/azure) for 7 years prior to joining GitHub.

I live in Seattle metro area and I love traveling and seeing the world. A personal fun fact: I made a personal goal to visit all the U.S. national parks years ago and I have visited 35 out of 60+ U.S. national parks so far.
