ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am [@dhei](https://github.com/dhei), an engineer from npm/GitHub who loves to build software that makes developers more productive. I worked for Microsoft [@Azure](https://github.com/azure) for 7 years before joining GitHub.

I live in Seattle metro area and I have a passion for traveling and seeing the world. A personal fun fact: I made a personal goal to visit all the U.S. national parks many years ago. 

As of 2025, I have visited 34 out of the 51 national parks in the contiguous United States, and [37](https://github.com/dhei/dhei.github.io/blob/main/posts/us-national-parks-rating.md#national-parks-ive-visited) out of the [63](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_parks_of_the_United_States) national parks in whole United States.
